            <p>
                The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares students to program in open-source
                technologies
                like <em>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React</em>, and <em>React Native</em> while
                introducing
                the development of Microservices and software techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
